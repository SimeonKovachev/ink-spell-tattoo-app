          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
          I’m Iva, a concept artist turned tattoo artist. I’ve spent over 10
          years bringing characters and worlds to life through illustration,
          honing my skills in anatomy, textures, and realism. After earning
          certifications in Character and Environment Concept Art, I've embraced
          the world of tattooing – blending my passion for art with the ancient
          craft of ink.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
          Each tattoo I create is infused with the storytelling and attention to
          detail I’ve developed over my career. Whether you’re seeking a
          mystical touch with astrology and Tarot-inspired art, or a custom
          design that speaks to your unique journey, I'm here to make it happen.
        </p>

          Let’s turn your story into a work of art you'll wear proudly.
